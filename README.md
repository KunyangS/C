ðŸ”¹ Overview**  
`runml` is a **C11-based transpiler and compiler** that translates ML-like code into **C11**, utilizing the C compilation toolchain for execution. This project demonstrates my **proficiency in compiler design, lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and systems programming** while optimizing performance and ensuring robust error handling.  

Beyond this project, this repository also serves as **a reflection of my C programming journey**, including my **practice exercises, coding techniques, and system programming explorations**.
